Hi guys,im Onesh and I built this project as my final challenge for my (AN1) course at meu-labs.
-With all the Python knowledge i've gained through a long period of time, I was able to use it as my Back-End code language.
-for the Front-End language I used Streamlit. 
Developed with Python and Streamlit, This app is easy, quick, and usable everywhere in the world. The interface does not have complicated instructions for beginners; it is intuitive and will allow anyone to look at any country's weather. Either for travel forecasts, for deciding what to do at daytime, or just out of curiosity, this dashboard offers current information without difficulty.
